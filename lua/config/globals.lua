--- Settings shared across the whole configuration

--- They live in the one global table `DyNeo`, named after the configuration,

--- afterwards and is free to override every one of them.

---@class DyNeo

---@type boolean Flag to set background. Read as the manual choice whenever
--- `DyNeo.day_night.enabled` is off, and overwritten by the clock when it is on.

---@field enabled boolean Let the clock decide `DyNeo.dark_mode`
---@field day_start integer Hour the light half begins, 0-23

---| 'stable' # Every plugin that tags releases on its newest release

---@type DyPluginChannel What `:Lazy update` moves plugins to. `latest` gets
--- fixes the day they land and breakage with them; `stable` trades that for
--- releases the plugin authors vouched for, and a released Neovim. Each keeps
--- its own lockfile, so machines on different channels never rewrite each
--- other's pins.
DyNeo.plugin_channel = 'latest'

---@type integer Seconds a release has to have been out before it may be
--- installed, by Mason (`tools.mason-quarantine`) or by lazy.nvim
--- (`tools.lazy-quarantine`) alike. It is the same week `min-release-age`
--- (npm), `minimumReleaseAge` (bun, pnpm) and `exclude-newer` (uv) give the
--- rest of these dotfiles, so a compromised release has time to be caught
--- and pulled before it lands here. Raise it on a machine that can afford to
--- wait longer; `0` turns the wait off and is what a machine being set up
--- from nothing may need.
