--- A quarantine window in front of mason's package index
---
--- The rest of these dotfiles hold every freshly published package back for a
--- week before it may be installed -- `min-release-age` in `~/.npmrc`,
--- `minimumReleaseAge` in the bun and pnpm configurations, `exclude-newer` in
--- `uv.toml` -- so that a compromised release has time to be caught and pulled
--- before it lands on this machine. mason has no such setting.
---
--- It does not need one per package, though: mason resolves no versions of its
--- own. Every package in `github:mason-org/mason-registry` carries its version
--- in the purl of the registry snapshot, and the snapshot is whatever release
--- of the registry repository is current, refreshed daily. Hold that one
--- release back by a week and every version it pins is at least a week old,
--- whatever it is installed from -- npm, PyPI, a GitHub release, Go, Open VSX.
---
--- This is a mason provider, and the only one in the `providers` setting. It
--- answers for GitHub releases itself and hands every other question -- git
--- tags, which the refs API gives no date to age by, and the versions npm,
--- PyPI and the rest list -- to mason's own providers in turn.
---
--- It has to stand alone: mason asks the next provider whenever one fails, so
--- with mason's own listed behind it, a quarantine that could not answer --
--- rate limited, offline, or with nothing old enough -- would let the newest
--- snapshot through. A failure here stays a failure, and mason keeps the
--- snapshot it already has.
