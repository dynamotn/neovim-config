--- A quarantine window in front of lazy.nvim's plugin updates
---
--- A plugin is as much of a supply chain as a package from npm or PyPI, and a
--- bigger one: whatever it has in it runs in this editor the next time Neovim
--- starts. The rest of these dotfiles hold a freshly published package back
--- for a week before it may be installed -- `min-release-age` in `~/.npmrc`,
--- `minimumReleaseAge` for bun and pnpm, `exclude-newer` in `uv.toml`, and
--- `tools.mason-quarantine` in front of Mason -- so that a compromised
--- release has time to be caught and pulled. lazy.nvim has no setting for it.
---
--- Every decision of what to check out -- `:Lazy update`, the hourly checker,
--- the update the UI offers -- goes through one function, `get_target`, so
--- that is where the window goes: `setup()` wraps it and hands back the
--- newest commit, or the newest release, that has been out long enough. What
--- lazy.nvim does with the target is untouched, so `:Lazy restore` still puts
--- the lockfile back commit for commit, and a pinned plugin stays where it is.
---
--- Nothing is held back that cannot be: a plugin whose history is younger
--- than the window -- a repository published this week -- is installed as
--- lazy.nvim resolved it, since the alternative is not installing it at all.
