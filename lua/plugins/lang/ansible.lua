--- The Python of Mason's ansible-lint, when ansible itself is not on `$PATH`
---
--- The server runs `ansible-config dump` as it starts and reports a failure
--- for every file it opens when that is missing. Mason installs ansible-lint
--- into a virtualenv that carries ansible-core along with it, but links only
--- `ansible-lint` into `$MASON/bin`. Naming that virtualenv's interpreter
--- makes the server put its `bin/` ahead of `$PATH`, the same as activating
--- it would.
