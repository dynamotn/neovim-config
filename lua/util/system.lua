--- External commands, run the one way the rules ask for
---
--- `run` is the usual way: in the background, with a deadline, its output
--- capped as it is read, and its answer handed over on the main loop. A
--- command that is not installed, cannot start or runs out of time comes back
--- as a failed result saying so -- never as an error, never as silence.
---
--- `sync` is for the few places nothing else will do: a file written through
--- `BufWriteCmd`, a reply the language server is waiting for, a plugin hook
--- that has to answer now. Those wait, always with a deadline, and always get
--- a result. `vim.system():wait()` gives back nil, not a result, when the
--- deadline passes while something the command started still holds its
--- output open -- a script running `sleep`, `sops` starting a `gpg-agent`.
