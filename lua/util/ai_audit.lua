--- A record of what each AI integration was handed, and what it was refused
---
--- `util.ai_guard` decides, at the one place each integration reads a buffer
--- or a path, whether it may. Those decisions used to leave nothing behind:
--- what was stopped said so once in a notification, and what went out said
--- nothing at all. This keeps them -- which integration, which file, when,
--- and whether it went out or was turned down -- so what left the editor can
--- be looked back on, not only what was kept in.
---
--- Only the name of what was handed over is kept, and a line range at most,
--- never its text: a log of what reached an AI must not become one more copy
--- of it.
