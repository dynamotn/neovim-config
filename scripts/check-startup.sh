# @brief Load the configuration in a throwaway Neovim and fail on any error
# @description
#   Opens a file of each language in it (see check-startup.lua).
#
# By default a spread of languages is opened, to keep the pre-commit hook
# quick; `CHECK_STARTUP_ALL=1` opens every one of them, as CI does.
#
# The unit tests (scripts/test.sh) load modules one at a time, so a syntax
# error or a bad `require` in the wiring between them is only found by opening
# the editor -- and in a chezmoi `mode: symlink` setup that is the real editor,
# already broken. Neovim is pointed at this tree
# rather than at `$HOME`, so the check reads what is about to be committed and
# not what was applied last time.

# (clojure-lsp) takes the working directory as its root, and leaves its cache
# there. Every file is opened by an absolute path.
